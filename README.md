You don't need this source code unless you want to modify the
package. If you just want to use the Stripe Python bindings, you
should run:

    pip install --upgrade stripe

or

    easy_install --upgrade stripe

See http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html for instructions
on installing pip. If you are on a system with easy_install but not
pip, you can use easy_install instead. If you're not using virtualenv,
you may have to prefix those commands with `sudo`. You can learn more
about virtualenv at http://www.virtualenv.org/
